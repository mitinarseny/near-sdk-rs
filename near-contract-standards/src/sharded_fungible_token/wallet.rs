/// # Sharded Fungible Token wallet-contract
//
/// The design is highly inspired by [Jetton](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/jettons#jetton-architecture)
/// standard except for following differences:
/// * Unlike TVM, Near doesn't support [message bouncing](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/forward-fees#message-bouncing),
///   so instead we can schedule callbacks, which gives more control over
///   handling of failed cross-contract calls.
/// * TVM doesn't differentiate between gas and attached deposit, while
///   in Near they are not coupled, which removes some complexities.
///
/// ## Events
///
/// Similar to Jetton standard, there is no logging of such events as
/// `sft_transfer`, `sft_mint` or `sft_burn` as it simply wouldn't bring any
/// value for indexers. Even if we do emit these events, indexers are still
/// forced to track `sft_transfer` function calls to not-yet-existing
/// wallet-contracts, which will emit these events.
///
/// However, to properly track these cross-contract calls they would need
/// parse function names (i.e. `sft_transfer()`, `sft_receive()`, `sft_burn()`
/// and `sft_resolve()`) and their args, while this information combined with
/// receipt status already contains all necessary info for indexing.
